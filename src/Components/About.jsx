        <h3>"Hey, I’m not just a bunch of code and colors – there’s a story here. Let’s dive in! 🧠💡"</h3>
        <h4>Hi there! 👋 I’m Logeswaran — a passionate learner 💡, creative builder 🛠️, and future-ready full-stack web developer 💻.</h4>

        <p>
          Ever since I wrote my first line of code 👨‍💻, I’ve been fascinated by how imagination turns into functionality ✨. I love the magic of the web 🌐 — where logic meets design 🎨 and creativity meets code 🔥. Whether it’s building smooth frontends with React ⚛️, crafting powerful APIs with Flask 🐍, or working with MongoDB 🍃, I enjoy turning ideas into real, interactive experiences 🚀.
          <br /><br />
          But I’m not just about code 👾. I believe in learning by doing 🧠 — I dive into projects 🧩, tackle bugs 🐛, and grow through every challenge 🎮. Every bug is a lesson, and every feature is a step closer to mastery 🎯.
          <br /><br />
          Outside the dev world, my hobbies keep me inspired 🎧✏️. I love listening to music 🎶 (it powers my coding sessions), watching tech content 📱 to stay updated, and creating digital art 🖌️ to flex my creative side. Whether it's sketching UI layouts or experimenting with animations, I enjoy blending art with logic 🎭.

        <h3>🔮 What’s Next?</h3>
        <p>
          I’m not here just to build projects — I’m here to build a career, a future, and impact 🌍.
          My dream is to work as a software engineer at a leading tech company 🏢, where I can learn from the best, solve real-world problems, and contribute to products that reach millions 🧑‍🚀.
          <br /><br />
          In the long run, I hope to start my own tech venture 💼, create tools that empower others, and mentor upcoming developers like me 🤝.
          <br /><br />
          The road ahead is long, but I’m excited, focused, and ready for the ride 🎢.
          I believe in consistency 🔁, curiosity 🤓, and never settling for average 🌟.
          Whether I’m working solo or in a team 👥, I bring passion ❤️, energy ⚡, and creativity 💭 into everything I do.
          <br /><br />
          So if you’re someone who loves building cool stuff 🔧, solving real problems 💡, or just vibing over tech 🧑‍🚀 — I’d love to connect! 🤩
          Let’s talk 💬. Let’s build 🤖. Let’s create something unforgettable together 🌠.
